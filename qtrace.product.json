For complicated defects that involve multiple steps to reproduce, qTrace automatically captures all involved screens, mouse and keyboard actions in order to generate intelligent defect records. These are attached to the defect in VersionOne as a PDF, Word or JPG file. You can also include additional test notes and system information."
