        "description": "VersionOne's integration with Microsoft Team Foundation Server provides your organization with visibility into change while freeing the development team to focus on deliverables. This is accomplished by associating TFS builds and changesets with workitems in VersionOne. This visibility can be useful when tracking down defects or performing code reviews. It can also help with selecting a build to release or generating release notes. The TFS Check-in policy ensures that each check-in contains the information necessary to make this association. This package works with both TFS 2010 and 2012 but contains the policy for VS 2012."
