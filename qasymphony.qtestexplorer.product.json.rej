This simplified submission process will save testers time usually spent documenting, allowing them more time to find critical value added bugs that will increase software quality. qTest eXplorer is the leading exploratory testing tool, allowing for complete screen capture of exploratory testing sessions across desktop and mobile platforms. qTest eXplorer’s integration with qTest provides a platform for managing the progress of test sessions performed and the ability to edit sessions and submit defects from those sessions directly from qTest’s interface."
