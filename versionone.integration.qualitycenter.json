        "description": "As of Spring 2016 this integration was set to sunset status, the source is available below for extending this integration.** \n For support please submit a question to Stack Overflow using the tag versionone-hpqc \nThe VersionOne Integration for HP-ALM provides a two-way flow of information for tests and defects. The flow of test data makes it possible to monitor the quality of your projects more easily by making the latest test results visible in VersionOne. Teams can leverage existing test plans and test reporting, while creating new tests based on current user stories/backlog items. \n\n This integration will send tests from VersionOne to HP-ALM and update test pass/fail results from HP-ALM to VersionOne. \n The flow of defect data makes it possible to triage defects and include them in the planning process to balance new work and maintenance. You can leverage existing automated workflows and defect reporting in HP-ALM, while adding the practice of agile project management. This integration will send specified defects from HP-ALM to VersionOne and update defect status from VersionOne to HP-ALM."
