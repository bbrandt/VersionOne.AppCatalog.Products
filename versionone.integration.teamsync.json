        "description": "VersionOne TeamSync&trade; is an integration that provides portfolio and program leaders with visibility into the work that their teams are doing without disrupting the teams' current agile processes. TeamSync is designed from the ground up to allow VersionOne to coexist with other agile team tools while providing accurate and near-time rollup of the features that the agile teams are working on, including their features, backlog workitems, estimates, statuses, and effort. \n\n Using TeamSync, organizations can effectively plan their product releases and features in VersionOne, elaborate those features into backlog workitems in their external team tool, then as the team executes those backlogs workitems within their team tool, rollup the status and effort on those workitems as the teams progress through their agile iterations."
